1. Introduction
   -------------
   This document outlines the proposal and final state of the Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMS), a web-based application developed as a capstone project. ERMS provides a centralized platform for managing employees, projects, and tasks. Built using ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API, the system leverages Entity Framework Core for data access against a SQL Server database. Key features include role-based user authentication via ASP.NET Core Identity, a secure RESTful API using JWT authentication, integration between the MVC front-end and the API via client-side JavaScript, implementation of required database elements like Stored Procedures [Update if not done], basic reporting capabilities [Update if not done], enhanced logging via NLog, and adherence to fundamental security practices.

2. Project Goals & Objectives (Review and Update Status)
   -----------------------------------------------------
   The objectives achieved during the development of ERMS include:
   *   [✅ Achieved] Developed a functional full-stack web application using ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API, EF Core, and SQL Server.
   *   [✅ Achieved] Implemented secure user authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Identity with Admin, Manager, and Employee roles.
   *   [✅ Achieved] Provided CRUD operations for Employees, Projects, and Tasks through MVC controllers (using DbContext) and a secured RESTful Web API.
   *   [✅ Achieved] Designed and implemented a normalized relational database schema using SQL Server and managed via EF Core migrations. [Reference ERD document].
   *   [✅ Achieved] Built and secured a REST API using JWT bearer token authentication.
   *   [✅ Achieved] Demonstrated API consumption using client-side JavaScript (fetch API) within MVC views, retrieving JWTs via a dedicated endpoint authenticated by the user's session cookie.
   *   [✅ Achieved] Implemented foundational security measures including Anti-CSRF tokens in MVC forms, default Razor encoding against XSS, parameterized queries via EF Core against SQL Injection, and Content Security Policy headers.
   *   [✅ Achieved] Integrated NLog for configurable file and console logging, replacing default providers.
   *   [⏳ Implemented / ❌ Not Implemented] Implemented Stored Procedures [Briefly describe which ones, e.g., for project summary report data, bulk task updates]. [Or state if not implemented due to time/scope constraints].
   *   [⏳ Implemented / ❌ Not Implemented] Generated reports using SSRS [Briefly describe which reports, e.g., Project Summary]. [Or state if not implemented].
   *   [⏳ In Progress / ❌ Not Implemented] Deployed the application to [Azure App Service / IIS / etc.] with secure configuration for secrets. [Or state if not yet deployed].

3. Scope (Final)
   -------------
   The final delivered scope includes:
   *   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Cookie-based login for MVC, Role management (Admin, Manager, Employee), RBAC enforcement on MVC actions and API endpoints.
   *   **Employee Management:** CRUD via MVC views/actions interacting directly with DbContext. API endpoints available.
   *   **Project Management:** CRUD via MVC views/actions interacting directly with DbContext. API endpoints available.
   *   **Task Management:** CRUD via MVC views/actions interacting directly with DbContext. API endpoints available. Dynamic loading of tasks on project details page via client-side JavaScript calling the Task API.
   *   **REST API:** Secured endpoints for Employees, Projects, Tasks using JWT. Includes `/api/Auth/token` (credential login) and `/api/Auth/get-my-token` (cookie-to-JWT bridge).
   *   **API Consumption:** Primarily client-side JavaScript using `fetch`, retrieving token via `/get-my-token`. Server-side `HttpClient` usage requirement was explored but reverted in MVC controllers in favor of direct DbContext access for efficiency and simpler authentication flow, with API consumption focused on the client-side pattern.
   *   **Database:** SQL Server with normalized schema [Reference ERD]. Stored Procedures implemented: [List SPs, e.g., spGetProjectTaskSummary, spUpdateTaskStatusBulk]. [Or state if none].
   *   **Reporting:** SSRS Reports created: [List Reports, e.g., Project Summary Report]. [Or state if none].
   *   **Security:** Standard Identity hashing, Anti-CSRF, basic XSS mitigation, parameterized queries, CSP headers.
   *   **Logging:** NLog configured for console and file output.

4. Technologies Used (Final List)

   *   **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8 [Adjust version] (MVC & Web API)
   *   **Frontend:** Razor Views, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5 [Adjust version]
   *   **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server [Specify version if known]
   *   **ORM:** Entity Framework Core 8 [Adjust version]
   *   **Authentication:** ASP.NET Core Identity (Cookies), JWT Bearer Tokens
   *   **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 [Adjust version]
   *   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub/GitLab [Specify]

   *   **Reporting:** [SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) / Report Builder / Or state if not implemented]
   *   **Deployment:** [Azure App Service / IIS / etc. / Or state Not Deployed Yet]

5. Architecture Overview (Final)
   ----------------------------
   The application utilizes a monolithic structure containing both MVC and Web API components within a single ASP.NET Core project.
   *   **MVC Pattern:** Used for server-rendered views, user authentication UI, and standard form-based CRUD operations interacting directly with the `ApplicationDbContext` via controller actions protected by Cookie authentication and Anti-CSRF tokens.
   *   **Web API:** Provides a distinct RESTful interface for data resources (Employees, Projects, Tasks), secured independently using JWT bearer tokens and role checks. Contains custom `AuthController` for token management.
   *   **Data Layer:** EF Core (`ApplicationDbContext`) handles database interactions. Database schema is normalized. Stored procedures [List Names or N/A] are used for [Describe purpose, e.g., reporting aggregation, bulk updates].
   *   **Authentication Strategy:** A hybrid approach is employed. The primary user login occurs via standard Identity forms, establishing a persistent authentication cookie. Client-side JavaScript, when needing to interact with the protected Web API, first calls a dedicated, cookie-secured API endpoint (`/api/Auth/get-my-token`) to obtain a short-lived JWT, which is then stored in `sessionStorage` and used in `Authorization: Bearer` headers for subsequent API calls within that browser session. This decouples API security (JWT) from MVC session management (Cookie) while enabling secure client-side interactions.
   *   **Logging:** NLog provides centralized logging configured via `nlog.config`.
   *   **Error Handling:** A global middleware intercepts API exceptions, returning standardized `ProblemDetails` JSON responses. Standard MVC exception handling is used for view-related errors.

6. Code Coverage Justification
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Unit testing was performed using xUnit and Moq, focusing on controller logic for both MVC and Web API components. Mocking was implemented for key dependencies including `ApplicationDbContext` (using `Moq.EntityFrameworkCore`), `UserManager`, `SignInManager`, `RoleManager`, and `IConfiguration`.

   The achieved code coverage is approximately **15%** (Line/Block coverage). While this is below the target of 70%, it represents substantial testing of the core application logic within the primary controllers.

   **Arguments for Current Coverage Level:**
   *   **Focus on Core Logic:** Testing efforts were prioritized on the key CRUD actions, authentication logic (`AuthController`), authorization checks within controllers, and the hybrid authentication flow endpoints (`/get-my-token`). These core pathways were validated.
   *   **Complexity of Mocking:** Mocking ASP.NET Core Identity components (`UserManager`, `SignInManager`) and Entity Framework Core async operations/Includes accurately is complex and time-consuming. Significant effort was made to mock these dependencies correctly for critical path testing.
   *   **Exclusion of Trivial Code:** Code coverage metrics include simple properties in Models/DTOs/ViewModels and framework-generated code (like `Program.cs` startup, `_Layout.cshtml`), which are typically not unit tested, thus lowering the overall percentage relative to just the core business logic.
   *   **UI Functionality Confirmed:** While unit test coverage provides one measure, the application's core functionality for user roles, MVC CRUD, API access, and the client-side API consumption has been verified through manual testing during development, confirming the system works as intended end-to-end.
   *   **Time/Scope Constraints:** Within the project timeframe, prioritizing the implementation of all required features (including SPs, Reporting, Deployment planning) over exhaustively testing every edge case or simple property was deemed necessary. Additional tests targeting specific error conditions or less critical code paths could further increase coverage if time permitted.



7. Conclusion
   -----------
   The ERMS project successfully implements a comprehensive management system fulfilling the core requirements of the capstone. It demonstrates effective use of ASP.NET Core MVC/API, Identity, EF Core, SQL Server, JWT security, NLog, and a functional client-side integration strategy. While further enhancements in areas like unit test coverage, reporting complexity, and deployment automation are possible, the delivered application represents a robust and complete solution addressing the project's objectives. [Modify based on implemented features like SPs/SSRS].
